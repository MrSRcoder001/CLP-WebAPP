                <h2>INTRODUCTION JS LANGUAGE</h2><br>
                - Today, I am creating this JavaScript tutorial to provide you with a resource that will help you learn
                JavaScript. <br> - Also, you can use this tutorial as a reference later to lookup various concepts and
                code.<br>

                - Imagine a website as a house. HTML is like the bricks and walls that give it structure.<br>- CSS is
                like the
                paint and decorations that make it look nice. But without JavaScript, the house won't have any
                lights or
                running water—nothing would work or move.<br>

                - JavaScript is what makes a website interactive. <br> - It's like adding electricity to the house.
                <br>- It lets you
                click buttons to open doors, turn on lights, or even play music.<br>- So, without JavaScript, a website
                would
                be like a house where nothing really happens—you could look at it. <br> - The video below shows a modal
                which
                is created using JavaScript

                <h2>JS Execution</h2><br>
                * Do we need to install Javascript?<br>
                --> The answer is NO.<br>

                - JavaScript is present everywhere in browsers, on your phone, etc.<br><br>

                * How to execute JavaScript?<br>
                --> JavaScript can be executed right inside one’s browser. You can open the JS console and start writing
                JS there.<br>

                - Another way to execute JS is a runtime like Node.js which can be installed and used to run
                JavaScript code.<br>

                - Yet another way to execute JavaScript is by inserting it inside the ''<scripts>'' tag of an HTML
                    document.<br><br>

                    * What is JavaScript?<br>
                    --> JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used in web development. <br>- It is a
                    client-side language, which means that it is executed by the user's web browser rather than the
                    web server. <br>- This allows JavaScript to interact with the user and create dynamic, interactive
                    web
                    pages.<br>

                    - JavaScript is often used in combination with HTML and CSS to create web pages that are more
                    interactive and engaging.<br>- It can be used to create all sorts of effects, such as drop-down
                    menus, image sliders, and pop-up windows.<br><br>

                    * Getting Started with JavaScript<br>
                    - To start using JavaScript, you'll need a text editor and a web browser.<br>- There are many text
                    editors available, such as Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, which are all popular
                    choices among developers.<br>

                    - Once you have a text editor set up, you can start writing JavaScript code.<br>- To do this, you'll
                    need to create a new file with a .js extension and then type your code into the file.<br>- You can
                    then save the file and open it in your web browser to see the results. </p>

                <h2> Node.js Installation  </h2><br>
                Node.js Installation<br>
                --> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code
                outside of a web browser. <br>- It is commonly used for building server-side applications, command-line tools,
                and other types of scalable network programs.<br>

                * <b>To install Node.js, you can follow these steps:</b><br><br>

                --> Download the installer: Go to the official Node.js website <b>(https://nodejs.org/)</b> and click the
                "Download" button to download the latest version of the Node.js installer.<br>- 

                <b>Run the installer:</b> <br>-->Double-click the downloaded installer file to start the installation process.<br>- Follow
                the prompts to complete the installation.<br>

                - Verify the installation: To verify that Node.js has been installed successfully, open a terminal or
                command prompt and type the following command:<br>

                Run the following command:<br>

                -- ><b>node -v</b><br>
                This should output the version number of Node.js that you have installed.<br>

                - That's it! You should now have Node.js installed on your system and be able to run JavaScript code using
                the "node" command.<br>

                - I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.<br>
                - Script using Node.js
                To run JavaScript with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you will need to follow these steps:<br>

            --> Install VS Code: If you don't already have it, you can download and install VS Code from the official
                website <b>(https://code.visualstudio.com/).</b><br>

                - Create a new JavaScript file: Open VS Code and create a new file with a .js extension.<br>- You can do this
                by going to File > New File or by using the shortcut Ctrl + N.<br>- 

                Write your JavaScript code: Type your JavaScript code into the file and save it.<br> - 

                Open the Command Palette: You can open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P or by going to
                View > Command Palette.<br>- 

                Run the JavaScript file: In the Command Palette, type "Run JavaScript" and select "Run JavaScript file
                in the terminal" from the list of options.<br>-  This will open a terminal window and run your JavaScript
                file.<br> - 

                View the output: The output of your JavaScript code will be displayed in the terminal window.<br> - 

                Alternatively, you can also run JavaScript code directly in the terminal by using a command-line
                interpreter such as Node.js. <br>- To do this, you will need to install Node.js and then run your JavaScript
                file using the "node" command, followed by the name of the file. For example:<br>- 



                node myfile.js
                </p>
