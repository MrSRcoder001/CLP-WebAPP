                <h2>INTRODUCTION CSS</h2><br>
                - <b>Information & History</b><br>--->
                <br>-
                Let's start this journey of learning CSS together.<br><br>

                <b></b>What is CSS?</b> <br>-->
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>- It is a stylesheet language that is used to describe the
                visual
                presentation of a web page written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).<br>-

                HTML creates the structure of the page, while CSS adds styling to that structure.<br>- This tutorial
                assumes
                that you have prior knowledge of HTML.<br>- If that's not the case, you can follow the HTML tutorial
                first.<br><br>

                <b>Why the word "cascade"?</b>-->
                The term "cascade" refers to the priority scheme determining which CSS rules are applied when multiple
                rules target an element.<br>- This scheme takes into account specificity and inheritance, ensuring that
                the
                most specific and latest rules are applied.<br><br>

                <b>Why use CSS?</b>-->
                CSS is used to provide styling to HTML elements, making web pages visually appealing and
                user-friendly.<br>-

                Analogy to Understand CSS<br>-
                Imagine reading a book with only plain text.<br>- It's quite dull, isn't it? Now picture a book enriched
                with
                different colors, fonts, and styles. That's what CSS does to a webpage.<br><br>

                <b>How does CSS work?</b><br>
                CSS operates by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. <br>- Styles dictate the appearance
                of
                elements on a webpage.<br>- You can target HTML elements, classes, or IDs, defining properties like
                colors,
                fonts, margins, etc.<br>-

                /* Example of a CSS rule */<br>-
                selector {<br>
                property: value;<br>
                }<br>
                ** Quick Follow-Up Task:<br>-
                Right-click on the screen and select "Inspect" or press (Ctrl + Shift + C).<br>-
                Click on the arrow icon in the top-left corner of the inspection pane.<br>-
                Select elements on the page to toggle the CSS rules.<br><br>
                <b>Key Features of CSS:</b><br>-
                Styles and layouts of web pages.<br>-
                Works alongside HTML and XML documents.<br>-
                Enables responsive design for different screen sizes.<br>-
                Supports interactive effects like hover states and animations.<br>-
                CSS is now modularized, with ongoing updates rather than version numbers.<br>-
                Allows reusability of the same rules across multiple HTML documents.<br>-
                A Bit of History
                CSS was created by Håkon Wium Lie to enhance the visual aspects of websites. Initially, websites were
                mainly used by researchers and lacked visual appeal.<br>- As websites became more widespread, the need
                for
                better design grew.<br><br>

                <b>Important References:</b><br>-
                For beginners, start with the HTML tutorial.<br>-
                For more insights, check out CSS on Wikipedia.<br>-
                For advanced users, the W3C CSS Specifications is a valuable resource.<br>

                <h2>Your first CSS website</h2><br>-->
                In this tutorial, we will focus on creating our first CSS website.<br>-
                **We will divide the tutorial into the following parts:<br>-

                Setting up the environment.<br>-
                Creating an HTML page.<br>-
                Adding CSS to HTML.<br><br>
                <b>Setting up the Environment</b><br>-
                Installing VS Code<br>-
                Go to Google using your preferred browser.<br>-
                Type Visual Studio Code download in the search bar.<br>-
                Click on download and follow the installation instructions for your OS.<br>-
                Here's a quick video showing the VS Code installation process:on YouTube<br>**


                Installing the Live Server Extension<br>-
                We will also install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code to enable live reloading of
                pages.<br>-

                The Live Server extension launches a local development server and reloads the page live as you make
                changes.<br><br>


                ** Creating an HTML Page<br>-
                If you're not comfortable with HTML, you can start by following this HTML Tutorial.<br>-

                Assuming you have some knowledge of HTML, open VS Code and create a new file named `index.html`.<br>**

                Creating an HTML file<br>-

                After creating the HTML file, type "!" and press enter. <br>- This will generate the default HTML
                boilerplate.<br>-


                The generated code should look something like this after changing the title and adding some content to
                the body:<br>-
                Adding CSS to HTML<br>-
                Now that we've set up the environment and created an HTML page, let's add some CSS to style it.<br>-
                Inside
                the head tag, add the following code:<br>-

                style><br>-
                body {<br>-
                text-align: center;<br>-
                color: white;<br>-
                background-color: purple;<br>-
                }<br>-
                /style><br>-
                You've successfully begun your journey into the world of CSS! As you follow these tutorials, you'll gain
                a better understanding of various CSS properties.<br>-

                <h2>CSS Working </h2><br>

                <b>How CSS works?</b><br>-
                We wrote our first CSS style but still, things wouldn’t be very much clear.<br>- Let’s look at how CSS
                works
                on the DOM model.<br><br>

                <b>How CSS Works?</b><br>-
                The following steps will help us understand more about CSS working :<br>-->

                The user types the URL and clicks enter.<br>-
                The browser makes a fetch request to the server.<br>-
                HTML is fetched from the server.<br>-
                HTML is converted into a DOM. In the DOM, each tag is considered a node.<br>-
                The browser fetches all the related files and assets that are linked to that HTML, such as external CSS,
                fonts, images, etc.<br>-
                The browser then parses the CSS and groups it based on the selectors, which can be tags.<br>-
                Each CSS is attached to its respective node. In this phase, CSS gets attached to its respective
                node.<br>-
                This is called a render tree.<br>-
                The render tree is the well-structured, well-arranged DOM node that will appear on the screen.<br>-
                The well-structured, custom-designed website is presented on the screen. This is called
                painting.<br><br>




                ** Now, there arises a question: <br><br>

                <b>What is a DOM?</b><br>-->
                A DOM is like a tree structure representation of all the tags and elements on the page.<br>- Each part
                of a
                web page, like headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, etc., will be part of the tree.<br>-

                You can think of it as a blueprint for a web page that web browsers use to understand and display web
                content.<br>-

                Consider the below example,<br>-



                The tags are converted into nodes. Each node establishes a parent-child relationship between each
                other.<br>-
                To be precise, Document Object Model(DOM) is a sort of API that represents and interacts with HTML
                documents.<br><br>



                <b>Some helpful References:</b>
                I will recommend going through, How HTML Works
                MDN will be a great source to get some more insights.

                <h2>Syntax of CSS</h2><br>--><br>


                - CSS follows a rule-based structure.<br>- Each rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
                <br>-Selectors
                pick the HTML elements, while declaration blocks contain pairs of properties and values.<br><br>

                <b>The general syntax for writing CSS.</b><br>-

                selector {<br>-
                property: value;<br>-
                }<br>
                ** Note: Semi-colon (;) at the end of each new property and property value is IMPORTANT.<br><br>

                <b>For example:</b><br>

                h2{<br>-
                color: blue;<br>-
                }<br>-
                In the example:<br>-

                h2: h2 is the selector.<br>-
                color: It's the property.<br>-
                blue: The property value.<br>-


                Within the declaration block, there can be multiple pairs of properties and values.<br><br>

                <b>Consider the example:</b><br>-

                button{<br>-
                color: white;<br>-
                background-color: black;<br>-
                border: transparent;<br>-
                border-radius: 5px;<br>-
                }<br>-
                Here, 'button' is the selector, and there are multiple pairs of properties and values. Each pair is
                separated by a semicolon ";".<br><br>
                </p>
            </section><br>

                <p>
                <h2> Ways to add CSS</h2><br>

                <b>There are three different ways to add CSS to an HTML page, which are:
                </b><br>-
                Inline CSS<br>-
                Internal CSS<br>-
                External CSS<br><br>
                <b>Inline CSS</b><br>-
                Inline CSS is used to add custom properties to specific elements. <br>- The added style will only
                reflect on that particular element only.<br>-

                To use inline CSS, Insert the "style" attribute within the HTML element's opening tag.<br>-

                Consider the code snippet:<br>-

                <b>
                    <'h1> style="color: purple;">I'm harry <' /h1><br>-
                            <'h2>I'm CodeWithHarry<' /h2>
                </b><br>-


                Here, the inline style of color: purple is attached to only the h1 tag.<br>-

                ** Note: The downside of using inline CSS is, that once the project complexity increases, it will become
                difficult to manage the styles of each and individual elements.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Internal CSS</b><br>-
                Internal CSS is used to apply custom style to the multiple elements on the same page.<br>- The style can
                be
                used throughout the HTML page.<br>-

                Internal CSS is defined in a style block, which will be inside the head section.<br>-
                Consider the code snippet:<br>-
                <b>
                    <'head><br>-
                        <'style><br>-
                            p {<br>-
                            color: red;<br>-
                            }<br>-
                            <' /style><br>-
                                <' /head><br>-

                                    <'body><br>-
                                        <'h1>CodeWithHarry<' /h1><br>-
                                                <'p>I'm harry, from CodeWithHarry<' /p><br>-

                Here, in the style block, selector p will target all p
                tags and assign them color:red.<br>**

                Note:<br>- The <'style>
                    block should always be in the <'head> section.<br><br>
                        <b> External CSS</b><br>- External CSS works similarly to
                        internal CSS but with a twist. <br>- Instead of
                        adding the styles within the HTML file,
                        we create a separate file with .css extension.
                        This file will hold all the styling details.<br>-
                        Then,
                        we link this file to the HTML page,
                        giving it the instructions on how to look.<br>- The
                        following video will explain,
                        how to link a CSS file to HTML.<br>- There is a new
                        <'link> tag in the head section,
                            and this link tag has rel and href properties.<br><br>
                            **The following points will explain each keyword's
                            meaning:<br>-


                            <'link>: This tag is used to create links between
                                different resources,
                                like stylesheets,
                                fonts,
                                and more.<br>- In our case,
                                we are using a link tag to link the CSS file
                                with the HTML file. rel="stylesheet": rel stands
                                for relationship,
                                this defines the type of relationship between
                                the HTML document and the linked resource.<br>- When
                                set to "stylesheet",
                                it specifies that the linked resource is a
                                stylesheet that will be used to style the HTML
                                content. href="style.css" : The href attribute
                                stands for "hypertext reference."<br>- It specifies
                                the path or URL to the external resource we want
                                to link. In this case,
                                it's the path to the external CSS file called
                                "style.css".<br><br>

                <h2>CSS Selectors</h2><br>-->

                <b>What are CSS Selectors?</b><br>-
                CSS selectors allow us to choose specific elements and apply styles to them.<br>- Suppose we want to add
                a
                custom style to only a specific tag(s).<br>- There, We can make use of CSS selector.<br>-

                <b>** There are different types of CSS selectors, which are as follows:</b><br>-

                Universal Selector<br>-
                Element Selector<br>-
                Id Selector<br>-
                Class Selector<br>-
                Group Selector<br>-
                <br><br>
                ** Let's look into these selectors one by one<br><br>

                <b> Universal Selector</b><br>-
                Universal selector represented by "*" targets all the HTML elements on the page.<br>-

                The syntax of Universal Selector is as follows:<br>-
                <b>
                    * {<br>-
                    property : value;<br>-
                    }<br><br>
                </b>

                ** Consider the code demp:<br>-
                <b>
                    <'html><br>-

                        <'head><br>-
                            <'style><br>-
                                * {<br>-
                                color: purple;<br>-
                                text-align: center;<br>-
                                }<br>-
                                <' /style><br>-
                                    <' /head><br><br>

                                        <'body><br>-
                                            <'p>Welcome to <' /p><br>-
                                                    <'h1>CodeWithHarry<' /h1><br>-
                                                            <' /body><br>

                                                                <' /html><br>-
                </b>

                Notice, Irrespective of the tag, the style will be applied to all the elements and tags.
                <br><br>
                <b>Element Selector (Type Selector)</b><br>-
                The element selector selects the target element based on the specific type.<br>- Suppose you want to
                underline all the <p> tags; in this case, the element selector will be the best choice.<br>-

                    The syntax of Element Selector is as follows:<br>-
                    <b>
                        p {<br>-
                        property : value;<br>-
                        }<br>-</b>
                    A selector can be any HTML tag. Here, we have considered the p tag.<br><br>

                    ** Consider the code snippet:<br>-
                    <b>
                        <'html><br>-

                            <'head><br>-

                                            p {<br>-
                                            text-decoration: underline;<br>-
                                            }<br>-
                                            <' /style><br>-

                    </b><br><br>


                    ** Note: Element selector is not recommended as the same tag can be used multiple times in the
                    document. So, overlapping rules can occur in the stylesheet.<br><br>

                    <b>ID Selector</b><br>-
                    The ID selector targets the elements based on the specific ID.<br>- It is written with the hash “#”
                    character followed by the ID name in the style sheet.<br><br>

                    ** The syntax of ID Selector is as follows:<br>
                    <b>
                        #ID {<br>-
                        property : value;<br>-
                        }<br>-
                    </b><br>-

                    Consider the code snippet:<br>-
                    <b>
                        <'html><br>-

                    </b>-
                    In the style block, the selector #title, will only target the HTML element having an ID of
                    "title".<br>-

                    Notice, how the property color: red is only applied to
                    <'h1> tag.<br><br>

                        <b>Class Selector</b> <br>-
                        The class selector does the same job as the id selector, a class selector helps group various
                        types
                        of elements.<br>- Suppose, we want to give a custom style to a specific group of elements.<br>-
                        In this case,
                        the class selector is the best option.<br>-

                        It is written with the period “.” character followed by the class name in the style
                        sheet.<br><br>**

                        The syntax of Class Selector is as follows:<br>-
                        <b>
                            .class {<br>-

                <h2>Css Comments</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>-
                    Comments help with documentation and are helpful for the future users who read that code, so that
                    they can understand it easily.<br>-

                    Comments are ignored by the browser and Comments don't affect the styling or layout.<br>-

                    CSS Comments are enclosed between /* and */.<br><br>

                    ** There are two types of comments in CSS:<br>-

                    <b>Single-line comment:</b><br>-
                    Single-line comments are contained within one line.<br>- They are useful for short annotations.<br>-

                    Syntax<br>-
                    selector{<br>-
                    /* property: value */<br>-
                    }<br>-
                    for example:<br>-

                    /* This is a single line commnent */<br>-
                    p{<br>-
                    /* color: red */<br>-
                    }<br>-
                    here, the comment is between /* and */<br><br>

                    <b>Multi-line comments</b><br>-
                    Multi-line comments span across multiple lines, making them ideal for detailed explanations or
                    temporarily disabling blocks of code.<br>-

                    Syntax<br>-
                    selector{<br>-
                    /* property1: value1<br>-
                    property1: value1<br>-
                    property1: value1 */<br>-
                    }<br>-
                    These are similar to single-line comments, but this helps to comment large descriptions, notes,
                    etc.<br>-

                    for example:<br>-

                    /* This is a
                    multi line
                    commment */<br>-
                    p {<br>-
                    /* color: red;
                    background-color: purple; */<br>-
                    color: purple;<br>-
                    background-color: red;<br>-
                    }<br><br>-
                    Tip: If you are using vs code, you can use `cltr + /` to comment the line.

                <h2>CSS Specificity</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS Specificity helps determine what style will be applied to the HTML element(s) when there are
                    overlapping or multiple CSS rules. <br>- 

                    It is a value or weight assigned to a CSS selector.<br>-  The higher the specificity, the more precedence
                    the selector has.<br>- 

                    Let's consider the following code <br>- 
<b>
                    <'html><br> 

                    <'head><br>
                        <'style><br> 
                            * {<br> 
                                color: gray;<br>
                            }<br> 

                            #title {<br> 
                                color: red;<br> 
                            }<br> 

                            .h1 {<br>
                                color: blue;<br>
                            }<br> 

                            h1 {<br> 
                                color: pink;<br> 
                            }<br> 
                        <'/style><br> 

                    <'/head><br>

                    <'body><br> 
                        <'h1 id="title" class="h1" style="color:purple">CodeWithHarry<'/h1><br>
                    <'/body><br>

                    <'/html><br>-</b><br>


                    Here the question is, what color will h1 be assigned to? This is calculated based on the selector's
                    components which we will discussed in this tutorial.<br>- 

                    The Cascade Algorithm
                    CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets.<br>-  The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where
                    multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element.<br>-  It's the reason that the text of the button styled with
                    the above CSS will be purple.<br>- 

                    Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolves conflicts like
                    this. <br>- The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.<br>- 

                    Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear<br>- 
                    Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match<br>- 
                    Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS
                    from a browser extension, or your authored CSS<br>- 
                    Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important
                    rule type
                    Lets look into all these one by one

                    Effect of Position
                    If there are two rules that have selectors of identical specificity, the last one to be declared
                    won.<br>-  In an HTML page, you can add styles in different ways: through a
                    <'link> tag, a <'style>
                        tag,
                        or directly in the element's style attribute.<br>-  If you have one <'link> tag at the top of your page and another at the bottom, the styles from the bottom one will be used.<br>-  The same goes for <'style> tags; the ones lower down on the page take priority.
                        <br>- 
                        An inline style attribute with CSS declared in it will override all other CSS,
                        regardless of its position,
                        unless a declaration has !important defined.<br>-  If the browser doesn't support a property, it is ignored!

                        Specificity CSS specificity determines which style rules get applied to an element when there are conflicts. <br>- Higher specificity means the style will be used. It's calculated based on a point system involving inline styles, IDs, classes, and tag names.
                        <br>- 

                        Inline Styles Inline styles have the highest specificity and will always override styles if other selector(s) are also defined. <br>- 
                        <'html><br>- 
                            <'head><br>- 
                                <'style><br>- 
                                * {<br>- 
                            color: gray;<br>- 
                        }<br>- 

                        #title {<br>- 
                            color: red;<br>- 
                        }<br>- 

                        .h1 {<br>- 
                            color: blue;<br>- 
                        }<br>- 

                        h1 {<br>- 
                            color: pink;<br>- 
                        }<br>- 
                    <'/style><br>- 

                    <'/head><br>- 

                    <'body><br>- 
                        <'h1 id="title" class="h1" style="color:purple">mr_sattu<'/h1><br>- 
                    <'/body><br>- 

<'/html><br>- </b>

Here, you can see that the color: purple is applied to the h1 tag.<br><br>
<b>ID Selector</b><br>- 
The ID selector also has high specificity but comes after the inline Style specificity. <br>- So, if we have an ID and other
selectors except the inline style, then the element will take the ID selector properties and values.<br>- 
<b>
<'head><br>- 
    <'style><br>- 
        * {
            color: gray;<br>- 
        }<br>- 

        #title {<br>- 
            color: red;<br>- 
        }<br>- 

        .h1 {<br>- 
            color: blue;<br>- 
        }<br>- 

        h1 {<br>- 
            color: pink;<br>- 
        }<br>- 
    <'/style><br>- 
<'/head><br>- 

<'body><br>- 
    <'h1 id="title" class="h1">CodeWithHarry<'/h1><br>- 
<'/body><br>- 

<'/html><br>- 
    </b>
Here, you can see the color: red is applied to the h1 tag.<br><br>

<b>Class and Attribute Selectors</b><br>- 
Class selectors and attribute selectors have moderate specificity.<br>-  Suppose the element has a class or attribute selector
and not an inline style or ID selector, then the element will take properties and values from the class or attribute
selector.<br>- 
<b>
<'head><br>- 
    <'style><br>- 
        * {<br>- 
            color: gray;<br>- 

            .h1 {<br>- 
                color: pink;<br>- 
            }<br>- 
    <'/style><br>- 

<'/head><br>- 

<'body><br>- 
    <'h1 class="h1">CodeWithHarry<'/h1><br>- 
<'/body><br>- 

<'/html><br>- 


Here, you can see color:pink is applied to the h1 tag.<br><br>

<b>Element Selector:</b><br>- 
Element selectors like <'p>,
<'div>, <'a>, etc. have low specificity.<br>- 

        <'head><br>- 
            <'style><br>- 
                * {<br>- 
                    color: gray;<br>- 
                }<br>- 

                h1 {<br>- 
                    color: tomato;<br>- 
                }<br>- 
            <'/style><br>- 

        <'/head><br>- 

        <'body><br>- 
            <'h1 class="h1">CodeWithHarry<'/h1><br>- 
        <'/body><br>- 

        <'/html><br>- 
        Here, you can see color:tomato is applied to the h1 tag.<br><br>

       <b> Universal Selector:</b><br>- 
        Universal selectors (*) and combining selectors like not, first-child, and last-child have the lowest
        specificity.<br>- 

        <'head><br>- 
            <'style><br>- 
                * {<br>- 
            
                }<br>- 
            <'/style><br>- 

        <'/head><br>- 

        <'body><br>- 
            <'h1 class="h1">CodeWithHarry<'/h1><br>- 
        <'/body><br>- 

        <'/html><br>- 
     

        Here, you can see color:gray is applied to the h1 tag.

        So, the order of specificity is:

        Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

        Specificity Calculation
        To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

        Universal Selector: 0
        Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
        Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
        ID selectors: 100
        Inline styles: 1000
        Then, add up the values of all the parts in the selector.

        Here is an example

        <h1 id="title" class="h1">CodeWithHarry</h1>
        Here, the specificity value will be 111 because ID has a specificity of 100, the class has a specificity of 10,
        and the h1 element has a specificity of 1.

        In the case of a specificity tie, the rule that appears last in the CSS is applied.

        Importance
        The !important flag in CSS is used to give a particular style rule the highest level of importance, overriding
        any other competing styles. When you add !important to a CSS rule, it will take precedence over other rules
        affecting the same element, regardless of their specificity. For example, if you have:

        p {
        color: red !important;
        }

        p {
        color: blue;
        }
        The text in the <p> element will be red, not blue, because the !important flag makes that rule more important.

            an !important at the end of a CSS value gets a specificity score of 10,000 points. This is the highest
            specificity that one individual item can get.

            However, it's generally best to use !important sparingly, as it can make debugging and maintaining your
            stylesheets more complicated. It can override styles in ways that are hard to trace, leading to unexpected
            results.

            Quick Quiz
            What will be the specificity value of the following selector:

            a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover {
            color: red;
            }
            Solution
            To calculate the specificity value of the selector a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover, you can break down
            its components:

            Element selectors: a contributes 1 point.
            Class selectors: .harryclass and .rohan-class each contributes 10 points, totaling 20 points.
            Attribute selector: [href] contributes 10 points.
            Pseudo-class: :hover adds another 10 points.
            Add up all these values:

            1 (element) + 20 (classes) + 10 (attribute) + 10 (pseudo-class) = 41.

            So, the specificity value of the selector a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover will be 41.</p>
