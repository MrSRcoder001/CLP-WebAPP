                <h2>INTRODUCTION HTML</h2><br>
                - <b>HTML Introduction</b><br>
                --> Today, I'm writing this tutorial to create a resource that will help you learn HTML in less than 30
                days. <br>- Here's a recommended timeline for learning HTML, based on your educational background<br>

                - High School students and younger: Around 25 days<br>
                - Those beyond High School: Around 20 days<br>
                - College students and above: Around 10-20 days<br>
                - You may be wondering why I'm discussing these timelines.<br>- It's important for me to set
                expectations
                before you start your journey of learning html with me.<br>
                <br>
                <b>What is HTML?</b><br>
                --> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating
                web
                pages.<br>- It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like
                headings,
                paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. In layman's terms, HTML is like
                the skeleton of a website.<br>- It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text,
                images, videos, and other elements on a webpage.<br>- Think of it as the building blocks that create the
                structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.<br>

                * In a nutshell:<br>

                - HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites.<br>
                - HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet.<br>
                - HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically
                have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension.<br>
                - There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.<br><br>
                <b>Features of HTML</b><br>
                - It is platform-independent. <br>- For example, Chrome displays the same pages identically across
                different
                operating systems such as Mac, Linux, and Windows.<br>
                - Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page (For example - YouTube shows videos on their
                website)<br>
                - HTML is a markup language and not a programming language.<br>
                - It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc. to show interactive (or dynamic)
                web pages Learn computer programming. <br><br>
                <b> Why the Term HyperText & Markup Language?</b><br>
                - The term 'Hypertext Markup Language' is composed of two main words: 'hypertext' and 'markup
                language.'<br>
                - 'Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, while 'markup language' denotes a
                language that utilizes a specific set of tags.<br>

                - Thus, HTML is the practice of displaying text, graphics, audio, video etc. in a certain way using
                special tags.<br>

                ** Note: Tags are meaningful texts enclosed in angle braces, like '<...>'. For example, the '

                    <head>' tag. <br>- Each tag has a unique meaning and significance in building an HTML page, and it
                        can
                        influence the web page in various ways.<br>

                        <b>Quick Exercise:</b><br>
                        - Open a webpage of your choice, right-click on the browser, and select 'View Page Source,' and
                        then you will see the HTML code for that page.<br>


                        - This is the code that the server sent to display the page you're currently viewing. In this
                        tutorial, we'll learn how to write this type of code using HTML.<br>

                        - A beautiful analogy to understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
                        cwh tutorial image<br>

                        - In building a webpage, think of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as different parts of a car.<br>-
                        HTML is
                        like the car's skeleton, forming the basic structure and frame.<br>- CSS adds the paint and
                        finishing
                        touches, making the car look appealing with color, style, and design.<br>- JavaScript is similar
                        to
                        the engine and mechanical parts, infusing the car with functionality, movement, and interactive
                        features.<br>- Similarly, when developing a website, HTML lays out the structure, CSS enhances
                        its
                        visual appeal, and JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic content<br><br>

                        <b>History of HTML:</b><br>
                        - In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee established the World Wide Web (www), and in 1991, he created the
                        first
                        version of HTML.<br>
                        - From 1995 to 1997, further work was done to develop and refine different versions of
                        HTML.<br>-
                        In 1999, a committee was organized that standardized HTML 4.0, a version still used by many
                        today.<br>-
                        The latest and most stable version of HTML is 5, also known as HTML5.<br> -
                        Feel free to read more history of HTML here on the HTML Wikipedia page but I will move ahead and
                        cover important aspects of HTML.<br> -

                        In the next tutorial, we'll continue our journey and understand how websites work

                <h2>HTML Working</h2><br>

                - You must have heard of frontend and backend. Frontend refers to the visible part of a website or app
                that users interact with, like the tables, images, and buttons.<br>- It's built using languages like
                HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript.<br>- The backend, on the other hand, handles behind-the-scenes operations like
                storing
                and processing data when users interact with the frontend.<br>- It uses languages like Python, Ruby, and
                Java.<br>- In essence, frontend is what users see, while backend manages the functionality.<br><br>

                <b>How do websites work?</b><br>-
                When we want to access any information on the internet, we search for it using a web browser.<br>- The
                web
                browser retrieves the content from web servers, where it is stored in the form of HTML documents.<br>-

                An HTML document is created by writing code with specific tags in a code editor of your choice.<br>- The
                document is then saved with the '.html' extension. Once saved, the browser interprets the HTML document,
                reads it, and renders the web page.<br>
                - The text editor has the HTML code of a website.<br>- This website can now be viewed in a beautifully
                rendered
                format using a computer program known as a web browser.<br><br>

                <b> What is a Web Browser?</b><br>-
                A web browser is a program that understands HTML tags and renders them in a human-readable format that
                is easily viewable by people visiting the website.<br>- Developers write code in HTML because it's a
                straightforward way to instruct the web browser on what to display.<br>- In the next section, I'll show
                you
                how to set up VS Code for writing your own HTML code and rendering it in a web browser.<br><br>

                <b>What is an HTML Document?</b><br>
                An HTML document is a text document saved with the '.html' or '.htm' extension, containing text and
                specific tags enclosed in '<>'.<br>- These tags provide the necessary instructions for configuring the
                    web
                    page. The tags themselves are standardized and fixed.<br>- The structure of an HTML document will be
                    explained later in this HTML tutorial.<br>

                    <b>What is a Rendered Page:</b><br>-
                    The rendered page is the output screen of our HTML Document which is the page displayed on the
                    browser.<br><br>

                    <b>How does a basic website work?</b>-
                    Web Browser(client) requests websites like www.codewithharry.com from the web server.<br>-
                    Web server in return sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to it.<br>-
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are parsed by a web browser which is responsible for showing you a
                    beautiful website.<br><br>
                    <b>How does a browser work?</b><br>-
                    A web browser plays a crucial role in parsing and rendering HTML code to the client. A web browser
                    is a complex program that performs many tasks behind the scenes.<br>
                    ** Here's a summary of how it works:<br>

                    - A browser is an application that reads HTML documents and displays them as web pages.<br>-
                    Browsers can't
                    access the content directly from where it's stored; this is where servers come into play.<br>-
                    A server acts as an intermediary, listening to browser requests and fulfilling them by delivering
                    the HTML document to the browser.<br>-
                    Web browsers perform two main tasks: parsing and rendering.<br>-
                    During the parsing stage, the browser receives raw bytes, which are converted into characters.<br>-
                    These
                    characters are then converted into tokens, which in turn are transformed into nodes.<br>- These noes
                    are
                    organized into a tree-like data structure known as the DOM (Document Object Model).<br>-
                    Once the DOM tree is constructed, the browser moves on to the rendering stage.<br>- At this point,
                    each
                    node in the DOM tree is rendered and displayed on the screen.<br>-
                    Dont worry about how browser exactly works just yet.<br>- Rather focus on learning HTML.<br>- In the
                    next
                    tuotrial we will install VS Code and some extensions for writing our HTML code.<br>

                <h2>HTML Installation </h2><br>-

                Let's get our hands dirty and start preparing to write some code.<br>- In this tutorial, we will install
                VS
                Code and some related extensions for faster and more efficient HTML development.<br><br>

                <b> What are the prerequisites to learning HTML?</b><br>-->
                I can safely say that there are no prerequisites to learning HTML.<br>- HTML is the language of the web
                and
                is often the first step that web developers take in learning to code.<br><br>

                <b>Tools needed to make an HTML page:</b><br>-->
                - 1) HTML Editor: It's a straightforward tool where every piece of HTML content must be written.<br>-
                You can
                use any text editor of your choice.<br>- In this tutorial, we're using Visual Studio Code because it's
                lightweight and open-source.<br>-

                Popular editors for HTML development include text editors like Notepad++ and TextEdit, code editors such
                as Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code, and full-fledged IDEs like WebStorm and Eclipse.<br>- Online
                platforms like CodePen and JSFiddle are also commonly used for quick HTML editing and testing.<br>

                ** Note: You can write HTML even in a Notepad. Text editors like VS code make these things easier.<br>-

                2) Browser: HTML tags are not displayed by browsers; instead, they are read and interpreted to render
                the web page.<br>- In a web browser, HTML structures are displayed in a styled and visually appealing
                form.<br>-
                In this tutorial, we are using Google Chrome.<br>- Other commonly used browsers include Chromium,
                Firefox,
                Safari on Mac, and Microsoft Edge.<br><br>

                <b>Installation & Setup of Visual Studio Code for HTML:</b><br>-->
                - We will install and set up HTML to optimize its utility for creating web pages.<br>- Additionally,
                we'll
                install extensions in Visual Studio Code to enhance its functionality.<br>- If you're unsure about which
                editor to use, you can confidently start with Visual Studio Code.<br>- You won't regret it; it's one of
                the
                best free code editors available in the market.<br>-

                Search for "Visual Studio Code download" on Google

                In addition, we'll be installing the Live Server extension in our Visual Studio Code editor to view live
                reload pages.<br>-

                The Live Server extension is used to launch a local development server with a live reload feature for
                HTML pages.<br>-

                Your Journey to Creating Your First Website Begins Here!<br>
                Let's mark this as an important milestone: the creation of your first website! And what's a better way
                to start than with the traditional "Hello, World!"?<br>

                ** Why "Hello, World!"?<br>-
                In the programming world, "Hello, World!" is more than just a phrase.<br>- It's a tradition, an emotion,
                a
                simple program that teaches you the syntax and gets you started.<br>- And guess what? HTML is no
                different!

                Our first website will display the text 'Hello World'<br>-

                Let's Get Started: Setting Up Your VS Code
                If you haven't already set up your environment, let's begin by opening Visual Studio Code (VS Code).<br>

                ** Creating a New File<br>-
                Click on "Open Folder" and open a folder somewhere on your computer.<br>- I am opening a folder named
                html-tutorial

                Once VS Code is open, you'll want to create a new file:

                Click on the "New File" icon in VS Code.<br>-
                Type the filename as "index.html" and hit Enter.<br>-

                Pasting the Code
                Now that your file is ready, copy the following code and paste it into your "index.html" file.
                <br>-
                Going Live using the "live server" extension
                To see your webpage in action, locate the "Go Live" icon at the bottom-right corner of your VS Code
                window and click it.<br>- If you don't see this icon, you probably haven't installed the Live Server
                extension, which we discussed in a previous tutorial.<br>-


                ** Your First Website is Live!<br>-
                Congratulations! If you've followed along, you should now see your very first website displaying the
                classic "Hello, World!" message.<br>

                ** Live Preview Extension<br>-
                Another useful extension for working with HTML in VS Code is 'HTML Preview.' <br>- To install it, simply
                click
                on the extensions icon in VS Code and type 'HTML Preview' in the search bar. Install it!<br>-


                Now, you will see a button within VS Code. Clicking on this button will allow you to preview your HTML
                right within the editor.<br>-



                Once you click the button, you'll see a live preview of your HTML directly within VS Code.<br>-



                You don't even need a browser to render plain HTML. This live preview feature in VS Code is perfect for
                this HTML tutorial, allowing you to build and preview your entire HTML website without ever leaving the
                editor.<br>

                HTML Tags
                If you want to build a beautiful website, tags are essential elements that help you achieve that.

                An HTML tag acts as a container for content or other HTML tags. Tags are words enclosed within < and>
                    angle brackets.

                    They serve as keywords that instruct the web browser on how to format and display the content.

                    Commonly used tags in HTML
                    Here are some commonly used tags in HTML. These are the only tags used 70% of the time

                Paired and Unpaired HTML Tags
                Well, that was a really long list. Don't worry we will study these in detail. In HTML, tags can be broadly categorized into two types:
                
                1. Paired Tags (Container Tags)
                These are tags that come in pairs, consisting of an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag. The content goes between these two tags.
                
                Opening Tag: The opening tag starts with < and ends with >. For example, <p>.
                Closing Tag: The closing tag also starts with < but includes a forward slash / before the tag name, and ends with >. For example, </p>.
                Examples:
                Paragraphs:"<p>This is a paragraph.</p>"
                Headings: "<h1>This is a heading.</h1>" 
                2. Unpaired Tags (Self-Closing Tags or Stand-Alone Tags)
                These are tags that don't require a closing tag. They are self-contained, encapsulating all the information within a single tag.
                
                Self-Closing Tag: A self-closing tag starts with < and ends with /> (though the / is optional in HTML5). For example, <img /> or <br>.
                Note: Later if you happen to use react or a framework like Next.js, you will have to close the tag like this <br/> <hr/>. So it is better to cultivate the habit!
                
                Examples of self-closing tags:
                Line Break: <span><br/></span>
                Horizontal Rule: <hr/>
                Image: <img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image"/>
                Pictorial Representation of Tags
                The image below offers a visual representation of how tags are structured in HTML. As you can see, an element can contain other elements, which may also contain additional elements, forming a tree-like structure. This hierarchy can include self-closing tags as well as nested tags, as illustrated in the picture
